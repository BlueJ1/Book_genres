# Predicting Book Genres Based on Their Summary
This paper makes use of two hyperparameter space search algorithms (Random Search and TPE Search) with the aim of finding a Neural Network capable of predicting the genre of a book based on its summary. Our base architecture is a Multi-Layer-Perceptron, and our hyperparameter space contains variations on the learning and dropout rate, L2 regularization, model size, and data augmentation method and quantity. Results showed that TPE search more consistently found models with higher F1 scores compared to Random Search. However, the best models of each search algorithm performed similarly on both validation and testing data. When tested on validation data, the best models achieved an F1 score of around 0.7. However, the same architectures only achieved a final F1 score of around 0.17 when evaluated on testing data. Confusion matrices showed that the model mostly only predicted one genre (``fantasty") regardless of the true genre of the summary. The model's behaviour leaves room for improvements regarding data splitting and evaluation methods, augmentation methods, and data quantity.
